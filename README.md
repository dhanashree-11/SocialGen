# Community Landing Page - My First Web Development Project


## Description
Welcome to my first web development project, the Community Landing Page! This project was created as a part of my journey to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I followed a tutorial on YouTube to build this page and experimented with different concepts to enhance my understanding of web development.

The Community Landing Page is a simple and responsive website that aims to connect people with shared interests and hobbies. It features a clean and user-friendly design to provide a seamless browsing experience. As a beginner project, it allowed me to practice fundamental web development skills and gain confidence in working with these technologies.
